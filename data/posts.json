Here we are busy with another Longwalls album, getting into our fall routines and.. oh looky here: A new <a href=\"http://staticmotor.com/artists/kurt-von-stetten/\">KvS</a> album called <a href=\"http://staticmotor.com/shop/gutt/\"><em>Gutt</em></a>! I guess it has been a year since the excellent <a href=\"http://staticmotor.com/shop/bon-fortuna/\"><em>Bon Fortuna</em></a> record. Anyway.. Bold, defiant, insatiable. Boston's Kurt von Stetten returns with his 11th solo effort\u2014in 11 years. Noisy and angular. Low lows. High highs. Big and fragile. Playful and tuneful as ever. And once again written and recorded entirely on his own\u2014with Kurt himself playing every instrument.\u00a0And with 20 tracks (!!) you simply can't go wrong. Give Gutt a go! It's available (digital only) 10/28 here on SMR and over at Bandcamp (and eventually the iTunes etc..). Check out the first single, In a Car Falling in Love, and watch for video for Future is Fashion on Tuesday. Enjoy!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/289319401&amp;color= d86079&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

I've been moderating\u00a0a group on SoundCloud called \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/groups/indie-music-boston\" target=\"_blank\">Indie Music Boston</a>\" (the biggest moderated group for Boston in fact) for several years now and always thought it would be cool to produce a compilation album solely of artists from the group. While earmarking songs I liked, I soon realized most of them featured women\u2014either as solo acts or bands with women up front. And quite serendipitously, there's a \"time\" theme that threads through many of the songs. The idea for <a title=\"Full Circle\" href=\"http://staticmotor.com/shop/full-circle/\"><em>Full Circle - Commonwealth Women Up Front</em></a> was born. It's been an amazing experience rounding everything up for this project and feeling the enthusiasm of all the artists. So.. look for a release date of February 9. It will be digital only\u2014and FREE\u2014to download, though all the artists are getting CDs so you might be able to get your hands on one at their respective shows. And maybe in the spring we'll bring everyone together for a benefit show here in Boston. Full Circle. Stay tuned..",

Released in May 2005 to significant pre-blog era praise, <em>Floods + Fires</em> was Gatsby's only full-length (the band broke up shortly after its release). 10 years on, with the benefit of a little hindsight, there was a desire to approach the material with fresh, unencumbered ears. Featuring streamlined sequencing and two previously unreleased tracks, <a title=\"Floods + Fires [Turbo Edition]\" href=\"http://staticmotor.com/shop/floods-fires-turbo-edition/\"><em>Floods + Fires [Turbo Edition]</em></a> is a clangy wave a classic American indie rock; an album that captures the spirit of the early aughts Boston music scene like few others.</p>\n\n<p>If you're new to it, we encourage you to have a listen. If you're a fan, please enjoy this fresh take on a humble classic. Enjoy!</p>",

And this one is a bit of a milestone: 10 solo albums in 10 years with Kurt playing every instrument on every track. Perhaps more impressive is the fact that this album is just so damn dynamic and fun to listen to. It might be his best ever, and that's saying something. Check out the video for the first single, <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9UKNa5D2tZE?list=PLC98736F4D4BC2E30\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish Ship</a></em>, and be sure to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kvsmusic\" target=\"_blank\">hit up Kurt on Twitter</a> for a chance to win one of the <em>very few</em> custom physical copies he's producing at home as well as Bon Fortuna t-shirts.

Please don't be deterred!!! We'll gladly send you the MP3s in the meantime if you purchase the vinyl. It's a good one, now come get it.",
